Please read thoroughly the associated web page before attempting to use this add-in
http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm 

This version may not be compatible with the 64 bit versions of Office. If you have the 64 bit version (and you probably shouldn't, except in very limited circumstances) and only if you find that this version doesn't work, then download a cut down version of the add-in that does work in the 64 bit versions from http://www.gmayor.com/Zips/ManyToOne-64bit.zip

Note that Microsoft recommends the 32 bit version of Office for most users – even on 64 bit Windows versions.

With Word closed, extract the template to the Word Startup folder and remove any existing version that may be present. I have not included an installer as the installer for this add-in appears to cause no end of grief with false virus warnings from a small number of AV products. None of the main AV players find anything wrong with the template.

If you have not changed the preferred startup folder it can be located (in English language versions of Windows) by typing 
%appdata%\Microsoft\Word\Startup
in the Windows File Explorer Address bar and pressing Enter. 

The zip also includes the example files used on the web site.

The Windows SQL security check may cause problems with the data filter. If that occurs, for more information click the SQL button on the add-in's ribbon.

Note:
The example document is supplied as a normal Word document. Extract the example files to a suitable location. To enable the document to be used with the add-in, the data source, also supplied, must be attached (Select recipients from the Mailings tab and pick the data source). Save the document and then run the process.
